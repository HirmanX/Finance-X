# PyFinance

The first project with which I want to start programming.

This project is actually an accounting software using "Python" language.

## The most important features of this software:
-> Show expenses and incomes
-> Display data on specific dates
-> display a graph of data
-> Outputting data in an Excel file
-> Get data from Excel file

## Libraries that I used:
-> tkinter
-> pandas
-> matplotlib

This is a project for me to learn the programming language better and it is considered a kind of exercise and I want to challenge myself.
